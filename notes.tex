\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How is heat transfer different from thermodynamics? In thermodynamics, we assume quasi-equilibrium processes i.e. the time was not an important parameter. In heat transfer, time is an important parameter and we are interested in the rate of heat transfer. 
    \item What is the relationship between $\dot{Q}$ and $\Delta T$? What are the mechanisms of heat transfer? 
    \item Conduction: Transfer of heat through a medium that is stationary. 
    \item Convection: Transfer of heat from a solid surface and an adjacent fluid that is moving. Example: a fan blowing air over a hot plate. There is heat transfer from the hot plate into the fluid. 
    \item Radiation: Energy emitted by matter in the form of electromagnetic waves. 
    \item Radiation does not need a medium. In a vacuum, we can have radiation but not convection or condcution.
    \item Different mechanisms of heat transfer can take place simultaneously.
    \item Applications \begin{itemize}
        \item Power Generation \begin{itemize}
            \item Power plant: steam generation, condenser
            \item Automobiles: engine cooling, space heating/cooling
        \end{itemize}
        \item Buildings \begin{itemize}
            \item Heating / Cooling
            \item Hot water 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Refrigeration 
        \item Manufacturing \begin{itemize}
            \item Casting / Heat treatment
            \item  Injection Moulding
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    

\end{itemize}


\section {Electronic Cooling}


\begin{itemize}
    \item $>$ 99 \% of the electrical energy supplied to a circuit is dissipated as heat
    \item Heat has to be dissipated to the environment while keeping the temperature of the chip in a certain range
    \item Heat is lost from the surface of the chip
    \item Important parameter is heat flux $ = \frac{\text{Heat Transfer Rate}}{\text{Unit Area}}$ (in $\frac{W}{\mathrm{cm}^2}$)
    \item To reduce heat flux, we can reduce heat generation and increase the surface area 
    \item As size increases, it becomes more difficult to lose heat
    \item Water cooling is more efficient for large systems compared to air cooling
\end{itemize}


\section{Radiation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Radiation is energy emitted by all matter in the form of e.m. radiation
    \item Thermal radiation is emitted by all bodies at a finite temperature
    \item Opaque objects emit only from the surface
    \item Amount of radiation depends on the surface temperature. Summarized by the Stefan Boltzmann Law: $\dot{Q}_{emit} = \sigma A T_s^4$ where $\sigma$ is the Boltzmann constant ($5.67 \times 10^{-8}$ $\frac{W}{m^2k^4}$), $T_s$ is the surface temperature in Kelvin and $A$ is the surface area.
    \item A surface that emits as much radiation as this is called a "Blackbody". A real surface emits less than this.: $\dot{Q}_{emit} = \epsilon \sigma A T_s^4$ where $\epsilon$ is the emissivity and $0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1$ 
    \item Black paint has $\epsilon = 0.99$ which is very close to 1. Aluminum foil has a low emissivity of around 0.07. 
    \item If radiation is incident on a surface some will be absorbed. The fraction absorbed is a surface property known as the absorptivity $\alpha$ such that $\dot{Q}_{absorbed} = \alpha \cdot \dot{Q}_{incident}$ and $\dot{Q}_{reflected} = (1-\alpha) \cdot \dot{Q}_{incident}$
    \item Kirchoff's law says that $\alpha = \epsilon$
    \item Note: $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$ vary over different wavelengths
    \item Consider a special case of radiation \begin{itemize}
        \item Small surface which is completely surrounded by a much larger surface
        \item $T_s$, $A_s$ are temperature and area of the small surface (which is also the boundary), $T_{surr}$ is the temperature of the surrounding surface. Both surfaces are emitting and we are interested in the net emission
        \item $\dot{Q}_{rad} = \epsilon \sigma A_s (T_s^4 - T_{surr}^4)$ 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example \begin{itemize}
        \item Chip with an area of $15 \times 15 mm$, $\epsilon = 0.6$, $T_{surr} = 25$. 
        \item Two methods of heat transfer \begin{itemize}
            \item Natural convection \begin{itemize}
                \item $h = c(T_s-T_{\infty})^{\frac{1}{4}}$
                \item $c = 4.2 \frac{W}{m^2 K ^{\frac{5}{4}}}$
                \item $q_{conv} = hA (T_S - T_{\infty})$
                \item $q_{rad} = \epsilon A (T_s ^4 - T_{surr}^4)$
            \end{itemize}
            \item Forced convetion: $h$ is constant at 250 $\frac{W}{m^2 K}$ \begin{itemize}
                \item $q_{conv} = h A (T_S - T_{\infty})$
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Heat Conduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heat Conduction Equation \begin{itemize}
    \item $x,y,z$ components of $\dot{Q}$
    \item $T$ is a function of $(x,y,z,t)$
    \item $\vec{\dot{Q}} = \dot{Q}_x \hat{i} + \dot{Q}_y \hat{j} + \dot{Q}_z \hat{k}$
    \item $\dot{Q}_x = -k A_x \frac{dT}{dx}$ (similar expressions for $\dot{Q}_y$ and $\dot{Q}_z$
    \end{itemize}
    \item One dimensional heat conductivity can model more complicated situations. For example if $\Delta x < < \Delta y, z$, $\frac{dT}{dx} >> \frac{dT}{dy},  \frac{dT}{dz}$ so that $\dot{Q}_y$ and $\dot{Q}_z$ can be neglected 
    \item One dimensional heat conduction \begin{itemize}
        \item Cross sectional area is $A(x)$ where $x$ is the coordinate along which heat transfer occurs
        \item $\dot{Q}_x$ at the entry and $\dot{Q}_{x + \Delta x}$ at the exit
        \item Want to find $T(x)$ inside the object
        \item Rate of increase of enthalpy $ = m c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \rho V c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \rho c_p A \Delta x \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$
        \item Energy balance: \begin{itemize}
            \item $\rho c_p A \Delta x \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \dot{Q}_x - \dot{Q}_{x + \Delta x}$
            \item After simplifying and taking the limit as $\Delta x$ approaches 0, we get $\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{-1}{A} \frac{\partial (\dot{q} A)}{\partial x}$
            \item $A$ depends on the coordinate system and we use Fourier's law for $\dot{q}$: $\dot{q} = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cartesian Coordinates \begin{itemize}
        \item $A$ is a constant
        \item $p c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} [k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}]$
        \item Assume $k$ is constant. Then $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}$ where $\alpha = \frac{k}{pc_p}$. 
        \item If steady state i.e. $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0$ then $\frac{d^2T}{d x^2} = 0$. 
        \item Units of $\alpha = \frac{k}{pc_p}$, the thermal diffusivity is $\frac{m^2}{s}$. 
        \item High $k$ means the material conducts well. High $pc_p$ means that the material stores energy
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cylindrical Coordinates \begin{itemize}
        \item Heat being conducted radially so $\dot{q} = - k \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}$ and $A = 2 \pi r L$
        \item $pc_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{-1}{2 \pi r L} [\frac{\partial }{\partial r} \cdot \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}]$
        \item $\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial }{\partial r}(r \cdot \frac{\partial T}{\partial r})$
        \item At steady state, $\frac{d}{dr} (r \frac{dT}{dr}) = 0$. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Spherical Coordinates \begin{itemize}
        \item $A = 4 \pi r^2$ and $\dot{q} = -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}$ where $r$ is the radial spherical coordinate
        \item $\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2 \frac{\partial T}{\partial r})$
    \end{itemize}
    \item In general $\frac{1}{r^n} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^n \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}) = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$ where 
    cartesian has $n = 0$, cylindrical has $n=1$ and spherical has $n = 2$. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Thermal Resistance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At steady state, $\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = 0$
    \item Heat flux: $\dot{q} = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$. 
    \item Heat flux is a constant
    \item Heat transer rate: $\dot{Q} = \dot{q} A = \frac{-kA(T_2-T_1)}{L}$
    \item $\dot{Q} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{R_{wall}}$ where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the temperatures of the walls
    \item $R_{cond} = R_{wall} = \frac{L}{kA}$
    \item Similar to current with voltage and Resistance
    \item $\dot{Q}_{conv} = hA (T_s - T_{\infty})$
    \item $R_{conv} = \frac{T_s-T_{\infty}}{Q_{conv}} = \frac{1}{hA}$
    \item Radiation is more complicated. $\dot{Q}_{rad} = \epsilon \sigma A(T_s^4 - T_{sur}^4)$
    \item We need to define a heat transfer coefficient for radiation. $h_{rad} = \frac{\epsilon \sigma A(T_s^4 - T_{sur}^4)}{A(T_s - T_{sur})}$
    \item $h_{rad} = \epsilon \sigma (T_s^2 + T_{sur}^2)(T_s + T_{sur})$
    \item Can treat it as a resistance. $R_{rad} = \frac{T_s - T_{sur}}{\dot{Q}_{rad}} = \frac{1}{h_{rad}A}$
    \item Multilayer Plane Wall \begin{itemize}
        \item Each layer has the same surface Area
        \item Layers have thicknesses $L_i$
        \item Temperature varies as $T_1$ on the outside, $T_2$, ..., $T_{n+1}$ where $n$ is the number of surfaces
        \item Treat each layer seperately as resistances in series
        \item For first wall $\dot{Q} = \frac{T_1-T_2}{R_1}$ so $T_1 - T_2 = \dot{Q}R_1$. In general, $T_i - T_{i+1} = \dot{Q}R_i$
        \item Summing all of them gives $T_1 - T_{n+1} = \dot{Q}(R_1 + ... + R_n)$ so that $\dot{Q} = \frac{T_1 - T_4}{R_{total}}$
        \item Therefore you can sum up resistances similar to electric circuits
        \item We can find each $R_i$ as $\frac{L_i}{k_i A}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item $\dot{Q} = UA(T_{\infty, 1} - T_{\infty, 4})$ where $U$ is the overall heat transfer
    \item Example: Refrigerator Wall \begin{itemize}
        \item 1 mm thick insulation on the outside and width of refrigerator is $L$. 
        \item $T_{room} = 25C$ and $T_{refrig} = 3C$
        \item $h_0 = 9 \frac{W}{m^2C}$ and $h_i = 4 \frac{W}{m^2C}$
        \item $k_{steel} = 15.1  \frac{W}{m^2C}$ and $k = 0.035 \frac{W}{m^2C}$ inside the refrigerator
        \item Constraint is that $T_{s, out} > 20$. We assume heat transfer from the outside room to the inside of the refrigerator
        \item What is $L$ to ensure $T_{s, out} > 20$ to prevent condensation on the outside of the refrigerator
        \item Thermal circuit consists of a convective resistance outside the refrigerator followed by 3 conductive resistance on the surfaces and then one convective resistance at the end
        \item INSERT PICTURE FROM LEC NOTES
        \item $\dot{Q} = \frac{T_{room} - T_{s,out}}{R_{conv, 0}} = \frac{T_{room} - T_{s, out}}{\frac{1}{h_0A}}$
        \item Consider unit area. Then $\dot{Q} = h_0 (T_{room} - T_{s, out}) = 9(25-20) = 45 W$
        \item $R_{total} = \frac{1}{h} + (\frac{L}{k})_{metal} + (\frac{L}{k})_{insulation} + (\frac{L}{k})_{metal} + \frac{1}{h_i} = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{10^{-3}}{15.1} + \frac{L_2}{0.035} + \frac{10^{-3}}{15.1} + \frac{1}{4} = 0.361 + \frac{L_2}{0.035}$
        \item $\dot{Q} = \frac{T_{room} - T_{refrig}}{R_{total}} \rightarrow 45 (0.361 + \frac{L_2}{0.035}) = 25 - 3$ so that $L = 45 mm$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Thermal Resistance Networks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple layers e.g. in an electric chip each with different thermal properties \begin{itemize}
        \item We are interested in $\dot{Q} = \dot{Q}_1 + \dot{Q}_2 + \dot{Q}_3 = \frac{T_1-T_2}{R_1} + \frac{T_1-T_2}{R_2} +  \frac{T_1-T_2}{R_3}$
        \item $ = (T_1-T_2)(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}) = \frac{T_1-T_2}{R_{total}}$
        \item This is the electrical analog to parallel resistances
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thermal contact resistance \begin{itemize}
        \item So far we have been assuming perfect contact between different boundaries
        \item In reality, there is a rough surface at the boundary
        \item We can always define a thermal contact resistance $R_c = \frac{T_2-T_1}{\dot{q}}$ (units are $\frac{m^2 C}{W}$ (Note: Resistanc per unit area)
        \item The reciprocal of $R_C$ is known as the thermal contact conductance $h_c$. 
        \item $h = \frac{1}{R_c} = \frac{\dot{q}}{\Delta T}$ so that $\dot{q} = h_c \Delta T$
        \item $h_c$ is thus similar to the heat transfer coefficient
    \end{itemize}
    \item Heat conduction in cylinders \& spheres \begin{itemize}
        \item INSERT DRAWING FROM THE SLIDEs
        \item For a long pipe, the main temperature gradient is in the radial direction i.e. $\frac{dT}{dx} << \frac{dT}{dR}$
        \item Therefore we can assume 1-D radial conduction
        \item INSERT $r_1$, $r_2$ diagram 
        \item Solve heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates to get $T(r)$
        \item Steady state: $\frac{d}{dr}(r \frac{dT}{dr}) = 0$, at $r = r_1, T = T_1$ and at $r = r_2, T = T_2$
        \item Integrate this to get $T(r) = c_1 \ln r + c_2$
        \item Using the boundary conditions gives $c_1 = \frac{T_1-T_2}{\ln(\frac{r_1}{r_2})}$ and $c_2 = T_2 -  \frac{T_1-T_2}{\ln(\frac{r_1}{r_2})} \ln r_2$ 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Define thermal resistance of a cylinder \begin{itemize}
        \item $R_{cyl} = \frac{T_1-T_2}{\dot{Q}_{cond}} = \frac{\ln (\frac{r_2}{r_1})}{2 \pi L K}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Conduction in cylinders and spheres, Insulation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inner temperature and then two surface layers
    \item $R_C = \frac{1}{hA} = \frac{1}{2 \pi r L h}$
    \item $R_{total} = R_{c,1} + R_{cond} + R_{c,2} = \frac{1}{2 \pi r_1 L h_1} + \frac{\ln (\frac{r_2}{r_!})}{2 \pi L R} + \frac{1}{2 \pi r_2 L h_2}$
    \item Insulation \begin{itemize}
        \item $R_{total} = R_{c, 1} + R_{cyl, 1} + R_{cyl, 2} + R_{c, 2}$ where $R_{cyl, 2}$ is for the insulation
        \item For a sphere \begin{itemize}
            \item Insulation around a spherical metal tank 
            \item $R_{total} = R_{c,1} + R_{sph, 1} + R_{sph, 2} + R_{c,2}$
            \item $= \frac{1}{4 \pi r_1^2 h_1} + \frac{r_2-r_1}{4 \pi r_1 r_2 k_1} + \frac{r_3 - r_2}{4 \pi r_3 r_2 k} + \frac{1}{4 \pi r_3^2 h_2}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item R-value \begin{itemize}
        \item Thermal resistance. Thickness $L$, Surface area $A$ and thermal conductivity $k$
        \item $R = \frac{L}{k}$ is the R-value
        \item $\dot{Q} = \frac{\Delta T}{R} \times A$
        \item Units here are in imperial units i.e. $L$ is in feet, $k$ is in $\frac{Btu}{h ft F}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Critical Radius of insulation \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the area for heat loss
        \item Insulation: increase thickness, increasing conduction resistance and decreasing convective resistance 
        \item Can we increase heat transfer? \begin{itemize}
            \item Plot $\dot{Q}$ against $r_2$ to find the critical value of Resistance
            \item Equivalently set $\frac{d\dot{Q}}{dr_2} = 0$ to find the critical radius
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section {Heat Transfer from Finned Surfaces }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read Chapter 17.6
    \item How to find $R_{heat sink}$ for finned surfaces e.g. heat sinks in computers
    \item Add diagram from notes: We have a cylinder with cross sectional area $A_c(x)$ and heat transfer coeff $h$. \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider a thin slice of this with thickness $\Delta x$ some distance $x$ away from the end
        \item Energy balance $\dot{Q}_{cond, x}$ in and $\dot{Q}_{cond, x+\Delta x}$ out
        \item Energy in = Energy out: $\dot{Q}_{cond, x} = \dot{Q}_{cond, x+\Delta x} + \dot{Q}_{conv}$
        \item Let the perimeter of fin be $P$. Then surface area of element is $P \Delta x$ so that $\dot{Q}_{conv} = h P \Delta x (T - T_{\infty})$
        \item Simplifying the energy balance by taking the limit as $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$: $\frac{d \dot{Q}_{cond}}{dx} + hP(T-T_{\infty}) = 0$
        \item Using Fourier's law $\dot{Q}_{cond} = -kA_C \frac{dT}{dx}$: $\frac{d}{dx} (kA_c \frac{dT}{dx}) - hP(T - T_{\infty}) = 0$
        \item Assuming $A_C, k, P$ constant: $\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} - \frac{hP}{kA_C}(T-T_{\infty}) = 0$
        \item Define $\Theta = T - T_{\infty}$ and $a^2 = \frac{hP}{kA_c}$ (constant) so that $\frac{d^2\Theta}{dx^2} - a^2 \Theta = 0$ where the solution is $\Theta(x) = c_1 e^{ax} + c_2 e^{-ax}$
        \item Boundary conditions: $T = T_b$ at the left end while on the right end as $L \rightarrow \infty$, $T = T_{\infty}$
        \item Therefore we simplify by having $T = T_{\infty}$ at $x = L$
        \item In terms of $\Theta$: At $x = 0$, $\Theta = T_b - T_{\infty} = \Theta_b$ and $\Theta (\infty) = 0$ 
        \item This gives $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = \Theta_b$ so that the solution is $\Theta(x) = \Theta_b e^{-ax}$ 
    \end{itemize}
    \item What is the heat loss from the fin? $\dot{Q}_b = -kA_c \frac{dT}{dx} |_{x = 0} \dot{Q}_{fin}$
    \item $\dot{Q}_{fin, long} = \sqrt{hPkA_C} (T_b - T_{\infty})$
    \item Finite fin length: What is the boundary condition at the open end \begin{itemize}
        \item We can heat transfer is negligible so that adiabatic and $\frac{dT}{dx} = 0$ at the boundary
        \item At $x = L$, $\frac{dT}{dx} = 0$ so that $\frac{d \Theta}{dx} = 0$: $c_1 e^{aL} - c_2 e^{-aL} = 0$ 
        \item At $x = 0$, $\Theta = \Theta_b$
        \item Solve for $c_1$ \& $c_2$ and the following solution will be obtained: $\frac{T(x) - T_{\infty}}{T_b - T_{\infty}} = \frac{\cosh a(L-x)}{\cosh aL}$ 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Can do the same for $\dot{Q}_{fin, insulated} = -k A_C \frac{dT}{dx} |_{x=0}$ which will give $\dot{Q}_{fin, insulated} = \sqrt{hPkA_c} (T_b - T_{\infty}) \tanh(aL)$ where $a = \sqrt{\frac{hP}{kA_c}}$
    \item To account for heat transfer from the tip, we can add a length $\Delta L$ at the end and the area there will be $A_c = \Delta L P$ ($P$ is the perimeter of the fin) so that the corrected length is $L_c = L + \frac{A_c}{P}$
\end{itemize}
\section{Heat transfer from finned surfaces (contd)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fin efficiency \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Delta T$ given by the difference between the fin temperature and the surrounding
        \item Most efficient fin would have a uniform temperature $T_b$ everywhere
        \item This would imply an infinite thermal conductivity
        \item In this case, $\dot{Q} = h A_{fin} (T_b - T_{\infty}) = hPL(T_b - T_{\infty})$
        \item We define $\eta_{fin} = \frac{dot{Q}_{fin}}{\dot{Q}_{fin, max}}$
        \item For an infinitely long fin, $\eta_{fin, long} = \frac{\sqrt{hPkA_c}(T_b - T_{\infty})}{hPL(T_b - T_{\infty})} = \frac{1}{L} \sqrt{\frac{kA_c}{hP}} = \frac{1}{aL}$ which is in terms of physical properties
        \item $\dot{Q}_{fin} = \eta_{fin} \dot{Q}_{fin, max} = \eta_{fin} hA_{fin} (T_b - T_{\infty}) = h \eta_{fin} A_{fin} (T_b-T_{\infty})$
        \item $\eta_{fin} A_{fin}$ can be treated as the corrected area
        \item For an insulated tip, perform the same steps with the original definition to get $\eta_{insulated tip} = \frac{\tanh{aL}}{aL}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fin effectiveness \begin{itemize}
        \item How much has the fin increased heat transfer by?
        \item $\epsilon_{fin} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{fin}}{\dot{Q}_{no fin}}$
        \item $\dot{Q}_{no fin} = hA_c(T_b - T_{\infty})$
        \item $\dot{Q}_{long fin} = \sqrt{hPkA_c} (T_b - T_{\infty})$ so that $\epsilon_{long fin} =  \sqrt{\frac{kP}{hA_c}}$
        \item To increase the effectiveness, make $k$ as large as possible and maximize $\frac{P}{A_c}$
        \item Fins are most effective with low $h$ so they are used for gases, hot liquids
        \item Generally we use fins if $\epsilon \geq 2$
    \end{itemize}
    \item When can we assume fins are infinitely long? \begin{itemize}
        \item $\frac{\dot{Q}_{fin, insulated}}{\dot{Q}_{fin, long}} = \tanh(aL)$. $\tanh$ asymptotically approaches 1 as $aL$ approaches $\infty$
        \item In practice, if $aL \geq 5$ we can assume an infinitely long fin. But even $aL = 1$ has $\tanh = 0.76$ so it gives 76 \% of heat transfer of an infinitely long fin. Therefore $L = \frac{1}{a}$ is a reasonable length for a fin 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Designing a heat sink \begin{itemize}
        \item $\dot{Q}_{total} = \dot{Q}_{unfinned} + \dot{Q}_{fin}$
        \item From the definition of efficience $\dot{Q}_{fin} = \eta_{fin} \cdot h A_{fin}(T_b - T_{\infty})$
        \item $\Rightarrow \dot{Q}_{total} = hA_{unfinned} (T_b-T_{\infty}) + h \eta_{fin} A_{fin} (T_b - T_{\infty}) = h \left[A_{unfinned} + \eta_{fin}A_{fin}\right] (T_b - T_{\infty})$
        \item We can define a thermal resistance $R_{fin} = \frac{T_b - T_{\infty}}{\dot{Q}_{total}} = \frac{1}{h \left[A_{unfinned} + \eta_{fin}A_{fin}\right]}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Transient Heat Conduction} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider a solid at temperture $T_i$ and a liquid at $T_{\infty} < T_i$. The solid is dropped into the liquid. How does $T$ vary over time? \begin{itemize}
        \item We would expect the temperature $T$ to asymptotically approach $T_{\infty}$
        \item Heat Conduction equation: $\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$
        \item We set the first three terms equal to 0 by using the lumped capacitance approximation i.e. no temperature gradient in the body
        \item We would expect this to be valid when the object is small and has a high thermal conductivity
        \item Using an energy balance: $\dot{E}_{store} = - \dot{Q}_{conv}$
        \item $\dot{E}_{store} = mc_p \frac{dT}{dt} = \rho V c_p \frac{dT}{d}$ and $\dot{Q}_{conv} = hA(T - T_{\infty})$
        \item Equating the two, we get $\frac{d(T - T_{\infty})}{T-T_{\infty}} = - \frac{hA}{\rho V c_p} dt$ so that $\ln (T - T_{\infty}) = \frac{-hA}{\rho V c_p} t + C_1$
        \item Using $T = T_i$ at $t = 0$, we get $\ln \left[ \frac{T-T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_{\infty}} \right] = \frac{-hA}{\rho V c_p} t$
        \item We define a "time constant" $\tau = \frac{\rho V c_p}{hA}$ so that $\frac{T-T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_{\infty}} = \exp \left[\frac{-t}{\tau}\right]$
        \item The LHS starts at 1 and decays to 0 as $t \rightarrow \infty$. Moreoever at $t  =\tau$, the value is $\frac{1}{e} \approx 0.368$ 
    \end{itemize}
    \item The response time of a thermometer is usually $3 \tau$. However it is important to note that $\tau$ is a function of $h$ so it varies in different environments
    \item Moreover $\tau$ depends on $\frac{V}{A} = \frac{r}{3}$ for a sphere so to get a fast response time you would make it very thin
    \item When is a lumped capacitance valid? \begin{itemize}
        \item At steady state, the conduction in a solid must be equal to the convection in a fluid i.e. $kA \frac{(T_1 - T_2)}{L} = hA (T_2 - T_{\infty})$ i.e. $\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_2 - T_{\infty}} = \frac{hL}{k}$
        \item $\frac{hL}{k}$ is a dimensionless number and is known as a Biot number. 
        \item Note: $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the solid, $L$ is the length scale in the direction of conduction
        \item Suppose the Biot number is large i.e. $>> 1$ so that $T_1 - T_2 >> T_2 - T_{\infty}$
        \item If Biot number is very small, then $T_1 - T_2 << T_2 - T_{\infty}$ so we can neglect $T$ change inside the body (we assume uniform temp in the body) and use the lumped capacitance model
        \item By $<<$ we typically mean a Biot value $<0.1$
        \item In an irregular body, the length scale used is $L = \frac{V}{A}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section {Transient Heat Conduction in 2 and 3 Dimensions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A ball of volume $V$,mass $m$ and SA $A$ and heat transfer coefficient $h$ is droppped into a fluid
    \item Assume that the temperature $T$ is uniform in the body
    \item We had previously assumed that if $Bi < 0.1$ we have a lumped capacitance
    \item Example: Steel shaft, $k = 51.2$, $\rho = 7832$, $c = 541$ and $T_i = 300$ is placed into a furnace with $T_{\infty} = 1200$. \begin{itemize}
        \item How long before the shaft temperature reaches 800?
        \item We first calculate the Biot number as $Bi = \frac{hL}{k}$ where $L = \frac{V}{A} = \frac{\pi r^2 L}{2 \pi r L} = \frac{r}{2}$
        \item Then $Bi = \frac{h \frac{r}{2}}{k} = \frac{100 \times \frac{0.05}{2}}{51.2} = 0.05$ so we can apply the lumped value
        \item $\frac{T - T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_{\infty}} = \exp \left[ - \frac{hA}{\rho V c} t \right]$ where $\frac{A}{V} = \frac{2}{r}$
        \item This gives $\ln \left[ \frac{800-1200}{300-1200} \right] = \dots $ and solving gives $t = 859 s$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Transient heat conduction in 3 dimensions e.g. plane walls, cylinders, spheres \begin{itemize}
        \item What happens if $Bi > 0.1$? 
        \item In this case we cannot neglect the temperature gradients inside the body
        \item Have to solve the complete heat conduction equation
        \item Consider a solid wall with temperature $T_i$ on one side which then instantly becomes lowered to a temperature $T_{\infty}$ as it is placed into a fluid. 
        \item As time increases, the temperature inside the wall e.g. at the center decreases
        \item So in this case, $T$ is a function of $x$ and $t$
        \item For a plane wall $\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$ where $\alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c_p}$ is the thermal diffusivity
        \item Second order wrt $x$ so two boundary conditions are needed there. First order wrt $t$ so one initial condition is neeeded there
        \item This can be solved analytically but we will not do that
        \item We instead consider the lumped capacitance solution $\ln \left[ \frac{T-T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_{\infty}} \right] = \frac{-hA}{\rho V c_p} t$
        \item We take the characteristic length $L = \frac{V}{A}$. 
        \item $\frac{hA}{\rho V c_p} t = \frac{h}{\rho L c_p} t = (\frac{h}{\rho L c_p} t) (\frac{L}{L} \cdot \frac{k}{k}) = (\frac{hL}{k})(\frac{k}{\rho c_p})(\frac{t}{L^2}) = (\frac{hL}{k})(\frac{\alpha t}{L^2})$ where $Bi = \frac{hL}{k}$ which is unitless
        \item We define the Fourier number $Fo = \frac{\alpha t}{L^2}$ which is also dimensionless
        \item The dimensionless temperature $\Theta = \frac{T - T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_{\infty}}$ so that the lumped capacitance solution can be written as $\Theta = \exp (-Bi \cdot Fo)$
        \item A physical interpreation of the Fourier number can be found by considering a cube with side length $L$. Then $\dot{Q}_{cond} = k A \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = k L^2 \frac{\Delta T}{L} = k L \Delta T$
        \item $\dot{Q}_{store} = m c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \rho L^3 c_p \frac{\Delta T}{t}$ so that $\frac{\dot{Q}_{cond}}{\dot{Q}_{store}} = \frac{k}{\rho c_p} \cdot \frac{t}{L^2} = \frac{\alpha t}{L^2} = Fo$
        \item Even when we cannot assume lumped capacitance and get an exact solution of the heat conduction equation, the solution is of the form $\Theta = \Theta (Bi, Fo)$
        \item We can define $\Theta_0 = \frac{T_0 - T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_{\infty}}$ so that the solution is of the form $\Theta_0 = A_1 e^{-\lambda_1^2 Fo}$ where $A_1, \lambda_1$ are function of $Bi$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example: Carbon steel plate with $T_i = 440$ is placed in a furnace at $T_{\infty} = 600$. We need to heat to a minimum temperature of 520. What is the time $t$ required. \begin{itemize}
        \item $h = 200$, $k = 40$ and $\alpha = 8 \times 10^{-6}$
        \item $Bi = \frac{hL}{k} = \frac{200 \times 0.04}{40} = 0.2$
        \item Since $Bi > 0.1$, we cannot use the lumped capacitance and instead use the analytical solution which we obtain from tables
        \item From Table 18.2, $Bi = 0.2 \implies \lambda_1 = 0.4328, A_1 = 1.0311$
        \item $\Theta_0 = \frac{T_0 - T_{\infty}}{T_i - T_{\infty}} = A_1 e^{- \lambda_1^2 Fo}$
        \item $\Theta_0 = \frac{520 - 600}{440-600} = 0.5$ so that $0.5 = 1.0311 \exp (- (0.4328)^2 Fo)$ and so $Fo = 3.864$
        \item $Fo = \frac{\alpha t}{L^2} \implies t = \frac{Fo L^2}{\alpha} = \frac{3.864 \times (0.04)^2}{8 \times 10^{-6}} = 773 s$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Transient Heat Conduction in Semi-Infinite Solids} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The general problem consists of a body at temperature $T_i$ with the surface temperature suddenly being changed to $T_s$.  \begin{itemize}
        \item Temperature variation would go from $T_s$ down to $T_i$. $\delta$ corresponds to a skin depth and after that we are in the core 
        \item How does the skin depth $\delta$ vary with time?
        \item Heat conduction equation with one dimension: $\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$
        \item An estimate of $\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}$ can be found as $\frac{(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x})_{x \sim \delta} - (\frac{\partial T}{\partial x})_{x \sim 0} }{\delta}$
        \item $(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x})_{x = 0} \sim \frac{T_i - T_s}{\delta}$ so that $\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} \sim 0 - \frac{T_i - T_s}{\delta ^2}$, $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \sim \frac{T_s - T_i}{t}$
        \item From the heat conduction equation $- \frac{T_i - T_s}{\delta ^2} \sim \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{T_s - T_i}{t}$ 
        \item Time for effect to be felt throughout the body is $t_c \sim \frac{r_0^2}{\alpha}$
        \item $\delta \sim \sqrt{\alpha t} $
        \item For a short time $t << t_c$, we can treat the body as being semi infinite
        \item The exact solution is given by $\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$
        \item $\delta$ grows as a function of time
        \item Boundary conditions: At $x= 0$, $T(0, t) = T_s$ and as $x \rightarrow \, \, \infty  T(\infty, t) = T_i$
        \item Initial conditions: $T(x, 0) = T_i$
        \item Define a similarity variable $\eta = \frac{x}{\delta}$ such that $0 < \eta < 1$
        \item $\eta = \frac{x}{2 \sqrt{\alpha t}}$ so that $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{dT}{d \eta} \cdot \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ \frac{-x}{4t \sqrt{\alpha t}} \right]$
        \item $\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \frac{dT}{d \eta} \cdot \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = \frac{dT}{d \eta} \left[ \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{at}} \right]$
        \item $\frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial x^2} = \frac{d}{d \eta} (\frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta}) \cdot \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = \frac{d^2 T}{d \eta} = \frac{1}{4 \alpha t}$
        \item Transforming the heat conduction equation, we get $\frac{d^2T}{d \eta ^2} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{dT}{d \eta} (\frac{-x}{4 t \sqrt{\alpha t}}) = -2 \eta \frac{dT}{d \eta}$
        \item The PDE is now an ODE
        \item At $x = 0$, $\eta = 0$, $T(0) = T_s$ and as $x \rightarrow \infty$, $\eta \rightarrow \infty$, $T(\infty) = T_i$
        \item Let $w = \frac{dT}{d \eta}$ so that $\frac{dw}{d \eta} = -2 \eta w$ which gives $\ln w = - \eta^2 + c_0$
        \item $\frac{dT}{d \eta} = w = c_0 e^{-\eta ^2}$ and integrating, $T  = c_0 \int_{0}^{\eta} e^{-u^2} \, du + c_1$
        \item Boundary conditions give $T_i = c_0 \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-u^2} \, du + T_s$ which gives the solution $\frac{T - T_s}{T_i - T_s} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{\eta} e^{-u^2} \, du = erf(\eta)$ where the RHS is the error function
        \item Can also be written as $1 - \frac{T - T_s}{T_i - T_s} = 1 - erf(\eta)$ or $\frac{T-T_i}{T_s - T_i} = erfc(\eta)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Heat Flux at Surface \begin{itemize} 
    \item $\dot{q}_s = -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} |_{x=0} = 0k \frac{\partial T}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} |_{\eta = 0}$
    \item $\frac{d \eta}{dx} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\alpha t}}$
    \item $\dot{q} = \frac{k (T_s - T_i)}{\sqrt{\pi \alpha t}}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Contact of two semi-infinite bodies \begin{itemize}
        \item One body with temperature $T_{A, i}$ and conductivity $k_A$ and the other with $T_{B, i}$ and $k_B$
        \item We require that $T_{S, A} = T_{S, B}$
        \item The heat flux must be the same i.e. $\dot{q}_{S, A} = \dot{q}_{S, B}$
        \item $- \frac{k_A (T_s - T_{A, i})}{\sqrt{\pi (\alpha_a t)}} = \frac{k_B (T_s - T_{B, i})}{\sqrt{\pi (\alpha_B t)}} $
        \item $\implies \frac{T_{A, i} - T_s}{T_s - T_{B, i}} = \frac{\sqrt{(k \rho c)_B}}{\sqrt{(k \rho c)_A}}$
        \item Define effusivity as $\gamma = \sqrt{k \rho c}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Forced convection, Velocity and Thermal boundary layers, Reynolds, Prandtl and Nusselt numbers}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Forced Convection \begin{itemize}
        \item Convection is the heat transfer from a surface to a moving fluid
        \item Forced part means that motion is imposed by external means
        \item A surface at a temperature $T_s$ and a fluid with velocity $V_{\infty}$ and temperature $T_{\infty}$
        \item $\dot{Q}_{conv} = hA(T_s - T_{\infty})$
        \item How do we determine $h$? \begin{itemize}
            \item Quite complicated
            \item Depends on physical properties of fluid: viscosity $\mu$, density $\rho$, thermal conductivity $k$ and specific heat $c_p$
            \item Depends on the fluid velocity $V_{\infty}$
            \item Depends on the shape and size of body: Characteristic length i.e. for a plate it is the length $L$ whereas for a cylinder of sphere it is the diameter $D$. Differences for objects of irregular shapes
            \item Type of flow - laminar, turbulent
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Velocity Boundary layer \begin{itemize}
        \item Incoming flow at velocity $V_{\infty}$ and temperature $T_{\infty}$ and a solid plate
        \item There is a no slip condition at the interface between the fluid and the solid. i.e. the velocity at the interface must be 0 but if you move away, it will go back to $V_{\infty}$
        \item We can define a boundary layer thickness by choosing where the velocity is $0.99 V_{\infty}$
        \item At $y = 0$ (plate surface), $V = 0$. The heat transfer there is thus by conduction only so that Fouriers law applies
        \item Here $\dot{q}_{cond} = -k_{fluid} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} |_{y= 0}$. We have also defined $\dot{q}_{conv} = h (T_s - T_{\infty})$
        \item At $y = 0$, $\dot{q}_{conv} = \dot{q}_{cond}$ so that $h = \frac{-k_{fluid} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} |_{y = 0} }{T_s - T_{\infty}}$
        \item Therefore $h$ depends on $k_{fluid}$ and the temperature gradient $\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} |_{y = 0}$. This leads to thermal boundary layers
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thermal Boundary layer \begin{itemize}
        \item Temperature of the surface is $T_s > T_{\infty}$
        \item Fluid coming at temperature $T_{\infty}$
        \item When the fluid comes in contact with the plate, there cannot be a discontinuity so it must be equal to $T_s$ at the contact point
        \item INSERT PIC FROM NOTES. We define the thermal boundary layer in a similar way to be the point where $T - T_s = 0.99(T_{\infty} - T_s)$
        \item $\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} |_{y = 0}$ is the temperature gradient. 
        \item $h$ changes with position as the local $\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} |_{y=0}$ changes
        \item We define a local heat transfer coefficient $h(x)$
        \item We can average: $\bar{h} = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L} h(x) \, dx$
        \item Instead of worrying about local variations, we use the average value of $h$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Velocity Boundary layer flow \begin{itemize}
        \item The difference between the boundary and the surfaces increases linearly as a straight path in laminar flow
        \item There is a transition region then where the path will start becoming unstable which eventually becomes a turbulent region with turbulent flow
        \item Fluid exerts a drag on the plate. Measured in terms of the shear stress (force per unit area) 
        \item $\tau = \mu \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} |_{y = 0}$ where $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity ($\frac{kg}{ms}$)
        \item Velocity gradient can be solved but it is very complicated and practically we define a friction coefficient
        \item We imagine a fluid coming to rest at a stagnation point. Using Bernoulli's equation, $\frac{P}{\rho} = \frac{V_{\infty}^2}{2} + \frac{P_{\infty}}{\rho} \implies P - P_{\infty} = \frac{\rho V_{\infty}^2}{2}$. This is the pressure rise and the force felt by plate
        \item We define the friction coefficient $c_f$ so that $\tau = c_f \frac{\rho v_{\infty}^2}{2}$
        \item Generally we expect $c_f \sim 1$ but this depends on the shape
    \end{itemize}
    \item Laminar \& Turbulent Flow \begin{itemize}
        \item Heat transfer is greater in turbulent flow i.e. with an increased velocity
        \item However when the heat transfer goes up, shear goes up and so bigger fans (more energy) are needed
        \item The transition to turbulence depends on the ratio of fluid inertia to viscosity
        \item A high inertia drives random motion and therefore turbulence
        \item A high viscosity damps turbulence
        \item Consider a mass with diameter $D$ and a fluid coming in around it at velocity $V_{\infty}$ \begin{itemize}
            \item There is an inertial force $F_i$ and a viscous force $F_v$
            \item Take the characteristic distance to be $D$
            \item The inertial force $F_i = ma$ where the mass $m = \rho D^3$ and the acceleration $a = \frac{V_{\infty}^2}{D}$
            \item The viscous force $F_v = \tau A = \mu \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} \cdot A$
            \item $F_v \sim \mu \frac{V_{\infty}}{D} \cdot D^2 \implies \frac{F_i}{F_v} = \frac{\rho V_{\infty}D}{\mu}$
            \item This number is known as the Reynolds number: $Re = \frac{\rho V_{\infty}D}{\mu}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Forced Convection Currents} \begin{itemize}
    \item Fluid with velocity $V_{\infty}$ and density $\rho_{mu}$. What forces are exerted onto the body (with characteristic length being the diameter $D$) \begin{itemize}
        \item Inertial force $F_i = ma$ \begin{itemize}
            \item $m \sim \rho D^3$
            \item The fluid starts with velocity $V_{\infty}$ and is brought to rest over a distance $D$ 
            \item $t = \frac{D}{V_{\infty}}$
            \item $\Delta V = V_{\infty}$ so $a \sim \frac{\Delta v}{t} = \frac{V_{\infty}}{\frac{D}{V_{\infty}}} = \frac{V_{\infty}^2}{D}$
            \item Thus $F_i \sim \rho D^3 (\frac{V_{\infty}^2}{D}) = \rho D^2 V_{\infty}^2$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Viscous Force \begin{itemize}
            \item $F_v = \tau A = \mu \frac{dV}{dy} \cdot A$
            \item $F_v \sim \mu \frac{V_{\infty}}{D} \cdot D^2$
        \end{itemize}
        \item We are interested in the ratio \begin{itemize} 
            \item $\frac{F_i}{F_v} \sim \frac{\rho V_{\infty} D}{\mu}$
            \item This is a very important number called the Reynolds Number $Re = \frac{\rho V_{\infty} D}{\mu}$
            \item The kinematic viscosity is defined as $\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho}$ so that he Reynolds number can also be written as $Re = \frac{V_{\infty} D}{\nu }$
            \item For small $Re$, viscous forces are dominant. Fluctuations in the flow are damped. This leads to laminar flow. 
            \item For large $Re$, inertial forces are dominant. Fluctuations in the flow become amplified and this leads to turbulent flow 
            \item For every geometry, there is a critical value of $Re$ at which a transition to turbulence occurs e.g. $Re _{critical, flat plate} = 5 \times 10^5$
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
    \item Two boundary layers are developing - velocity, thermal \begin{itemize}
        \item The velocity goes from $V_{\infty}$ down to $0$ and the temperature goes down from $T_{\infty}$ to $T_s$
        \item Let $\delta_v$ be the velocity boundary layer and $\delta_t$ be the thermal boundary layer
        \item $\delta_t$ may be smaller or larger than $\delta_v$. How do we tell? \begin{itemize}
            \item This depends on the physical properties of the fluid
        \end{itemize}
        \item Fluids with high viscosity $\nu$ (oils) have thick velocity BL i.e. $\delta_v$ is a large fraction of $V_{\infty}$
        \item Fluids with high thermal diffusivity ()$\alpha = \frac{k}{\rho c_p}$) have thick thermal BL
        \item The ratio $\frac{\delta_v}{\delta_t}$ is given by the ratio $\frac{\nu}{\alpha}$
        \item The Prandtl Number is defined to be this ratio: $Pr = \frac{\nu}{\alpha} = \frac{\mu c_p}{k}$
        \item $Pr$ is a fluid property
        \item For $Pr \ll 1$ (e.g. a liquid metal) $\delta_v \ll \delta_t$
        \item For $Pr \gg 1$ (e.g. oils) $\delta_v \gg \delta_t$
        \item For $Pr \sim 1$ (e.g. gases) $\delta_t \sim \delta_v$
    \end{itemize}
    \item We have two dimensionless parameters $Re = \frac{\rho V_{\infty} D}{\mu}$ and $Pr = \frac{\nu}{\alpha}$
    \item Need to non dimensionalize $h$ \begin{itemize}
        \item $\dot{Q}_{conv} = hA (T_s - T_{\infty}) \sim hD^2 (T_s - T_{\infty})$
        \item Suppose the fluid was not moving
        \item Then heat transfer is by conduction only
        \item $\dot{Q}_{cond} = k_{fluid} A \frac{dT}{dr} \sim k_{fluid} D^2 \frac{T_s - T_{\infty}}{D}$
        \item How much is heat transfer enhanced due to convection 
        \item This is given by the ratio $\frac{\dot{Q}_{conv}}{\dot{Q}_{cond}} = \frac{hD}{k_{fluid}}$ which is a dimensionless number
        \item This ratio is known as the Nusselt number $Nu = \frac{hD}{k_{fluid}}$
        \item Do not confuse with $Bi = \frac{hD}{k_{solid}}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item We started with $h = f(D, V_{\infty}, \rho, \mu, c_p, k)$ and dependent on the geometry
    \item This can now be written as $\frac{hD}{k} = f \left(\frac{\rho D V_{\infty}}{\mu} , \frac{\mu c_p}{k} \right)$ and dependent on the geometry
    \item $\implies Nu = f(Re, Pr)$ and geometry
    \item Can do experiments \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider a plate with a uniform heat flux due to an electrical current through it
        \item Can put it into a wind tunnel with $V_{\infty}$ and $T_{\infty}$
        \item We know that $\dot{Q} = h A(T_s - T_{\infty}) = P = EI $ (electrical power)
        \item We know the other variables and can thus solve for $h$ and plot it as a function of $V_{\infty}$
        \item Repeat for different plate sizes, different $T_s$ and different $T_{\infty}$
        \item Can plot $Nu$ vs $Re$ and all the data should fall on the same curve
        \item Repeat for different fluids to get different curves for different fluids
        \item Can then plot $\ln (\frac{Nu}{Pr^n})$ against $\ln Re$ and the data for different fluids will all lie on the same line
        \item $\ln (\frac{Nu}{Pr^n}) = m \ln Re + C$ or equivalently $Nu = c Re^m Pr^n$ where $n, m, C$ are determined experimentally for each geometry
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Forced convection correlations} \begin{itemize}
    \item Read Ch 19.3, 19.4. 19.5 - 19.8 will not be covered
    \item Dimensionless Analysis \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider a tube with velocity from the bottom \begin{itemize}
            \item $Z$ (height) is in terms of $P, V$
            \item What are relevant parameters? \begin{itemize}
                \item $P, V, z$
                \item Fluid properties: $\rho$
                \item Gravity $g$
            \end{itemize}
            \item Develop an equation relating $P, V, z, \rho, g$
            \item If we develop an equation, the dimension of both sides must be equal
            \item $P [\frac{N}{m^2}] = \frac{ kg \frac{m}{s^2} }{m^2} = [\frac{kg}{ms^2}]$
            \item $\frac{P}{\rho}$ is in $ [ \frac{m^2}{s^2}] \implies \frac{P}{\rho V^2} [\frac{m^2}{s^2} \times \frac{s^2}{m^2}]$
            \item $\frac{g}{V^2}$ is also dimensionless
            \item Therefore $\frac{P}{\rho V^2} = f \left(\frac{gz}{v} \right)$
            \item We plot $\frac{P}{\rho V^2}$ against $\frac{gz}{V^2}$ and we discover that all data falls on one line. If it doesnt fall on one line, the analysis was done incorrectly
            \item Thus $\frac{P}{\rho V^2} = - \frac{gz}{v^2} + C_1$ which when simplified gives $\frac{P}{\rho} + gz + \frac{V^2}{2}$ which is a constant. We can derive Bernoulli's equation experimentally in this way
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Forced Convection Correlation \begin{itemize}
        \item Flow over a flate plate
        \item $V_{\infty}$ flowing from the left, laminar region, then transition and then turbulenc
        \item $\tau = \mu \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} \sim \mu \frac{V_{\infty}}{\delta_V}$
        \item As $\delta_v$ goes up, $\tau$ goes down
        \item Local frictional coefficient $c_{f,x}$ goes down initially while in laminar, then goes up while in transition and finally goes down again in turbulence region
        \item For laminar flow $c_{f,x} = \frac{0.664}{Re_{x}^{\frac{1}{2}}}$
        \item Local Reynolds number = $Re_{x} = \frac{V_{\infty}x}{\nu}$
        \item Average friction coefficient over length $L$ of plate: $c_f = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L} c_{f,x} \, dx  = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L} \frac{0.664}{Re_x^{\frac{1}{2}}} \, dx = \frac{1}{L} 0.664 (\frac{\nu}{V_{\infty}})^{\frac{1}{2}} \int_{0}^{L} \frac{dx}{x^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{2}{L} \times 0.664 (\frac{\nu}{V_{\infty}})^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot L^{\frac{1}{2}}$
        \item This gives $c_f = \frac{1.328}{Re_L^{\frac{1}{2}}}$
        \item The heat transfer coefficient $h = - \frac{k}{T_s - T_{\infty}}  \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} |_{y = 0}$ so that $\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \sim \frac{T_s - T_{\infty}}{\delta_t}$
        \item As $\delta_t$ increases, $\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}$ goes down implying that $h$ decreases
        \item So $h$ decreases while in laminar flow, increases in the transition and then decreases again in turbulent region
        \item We define a Local Nusselt Number: $Nu_x = \frac{h_x x}{k}$
        \item For laminar flow, $Nu_x = 0.332 Re_x ^{\frac{1}{2}} Pr ^ {\frac{1}{3}}$ where $Pr \geq 0.6$
        \item The average Nusselt number is $Nu = \frac{hL}{k} = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L} Nu_x \, dx$
        \item This gives $Nu = 0.664 Re_L^{\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\frac{1}{3}}$
        \item For turbulent flow, $Re_x > 5 \times 10^5$ and $c_{f,x } = \frac{0.0592}{Re_x^{\frac{1}{2}}}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example \begin{itemize}
        \item Air with $T_{\infty} = 300 C$, $V_{\infty} = 10$ on a tube with $T_s = 50$ and $L = 0.5$. Find $\dot{Q}_{cooling}$
        \item The film temperature is used where $T_f = \frac{T_{\infty}+T_s}{2}$
        \item In this case, $T_f = 175$ and using $\nu = 3.18 \times 10^{-5}$, $Pr = 0.7$ and $k = 0.0363$ (using tables)
        \item Therefore $Re_L = \frac{V_{\infty}L}{\nu} = 1.57 \times 10^5$
        \item Flow is laminar since $Re_L < 5 \times 10^5$
        \item $Nu = 0.664 Re_L ^{\frac{1}{2}} Pr^{\frac{1}{3}} = 233.6$
        \item $Nu = \frac{hL}{k} \implies h = \frac{Nu k}{L} = 16.9 \frac{W}{m^2 C}$
        \item Cooling per unit width of the plate $\dot{Q} = hA(T_{\infty} - T_s) = 16.9 \times (0.5 \times 1) (300 - 50) = 2112.5 \frac{W}{m}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Flows over cylinders and spheres \begin{itemize}
        \item Flow seperation causes wake
        \item Not to be confused with turbulence 
        \item Turbulence occurs when $Re = \frac{V_{\infty} D}{\nu} > 2 \times 10^5$
        \item For flow accross cylinders, $Nu = c Re^m Pr^n$
        \item The values of $c, m, n$ depend on the range of the Reynolds number - given in Table 19.2
        \item Churchill \& Bernstein correlation is valid for $Re Pr > 0.2$
        \item Fluid properties evaluated at $T_f = \frac{T_s + T_{\infty}}{2}$
        \item Flow over a sphere has $Nu = 2 + [0.4 Re^{\frac{1}{2}} + 0.06 Re^{\frac{2}{3}}] \cdot Pr^{0.4} \left(\frac{\mu_{\infty}}{\mu_s} \right) ^{0.25}$
        \item All properties evaluated at $T_{\infty}$ and $mu_s$ is evaluated at $T_s$
        \item Valid for $3.5 \leq Re \leq 80000$ and $0.7 \leq Pr \leq 380$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Thermal Radiation, Black body radiation, Radiative properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read Ch 21.1 - 21.4
    \item Radiation \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider a solid at temperature $T_s$ with an enclosure outside at $T_{surr}$ and a vacuum in between
        \item Initially $T_s > T_{surr}$
        \item No conduction, convection since vacuum so heat transfer is by radiation
        \item Solid will lose heat to surrounding surface and cool until $T_s = T_{surr}$
        \item Thermal radiation: Energy is emitted by matter as a result of its finite temperature
        \item Energy is in the form of electromagnetic waves
        \item Radiation has wave properties: frequency $\nu$ and wavelength $\lambda$ related by $\lambda = \frac{c}{\nu}$
        \item Thermal radiation has a wavelength from 0.1 to 100 $\mu m$. This includes ultraviolet ($0.1 - 0.4 \mu m$), visible light ($0.4 - 0.7 \mu m$) and infrared ($0.7 - 100 \mu m$)
        \item For opaque objects, radiation occurs from the surface
    \end{itemize}
    \item Black body radiation \begin{itemize}
        \item A block body is a perfect emitter of radiation
        \item At a given temperature, no surface can emit more energy than a Blackbody
        \item A blackbody absorbs all radiation incident on 
        \item It emits equally in all directions. It is a "diffuse" service
        \item The Stefan-Boltzmann law: The radiation energy emitted by a blackbody per unit time and per unit surface area is: $E_b = \sigma T^4$ (in $\frac{W}{m^2}$) where $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$, $E_b$ is the blackbody emissive power and $T$ is the temperature in $K$
        \item A surface painted black is close to a blackbody for visible radiation 
        \item A white surface absorbs infrared light - can be considered a blackbody in IR 
        \item Depending on the wavelength, different objects can be considered blackbodies
        \item To get a perfect blackbody, you take a box with a small opening and the opening is the blackbody 
        \item This is because the aperture absorbs all light (anything that goes inside the opening reflects inside there and is thus absorbed)
        \item Radiation from a real surface encompasses a range of wavelengths. This is described by a "spectral distribution"
        \item Can plot Emission energy $E_{b, \lambda}$ against $\lambda$ to obtain a curve described by Planck's Law: $E_{b, \lambda}  = \frac{c_1}{\lambda^5 \left[ \exp(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}) -1 \right]}$
        \item There may also be a directional distribution
        \item Surface emits more in a given direction
    \end{itemize}
    \item Radiation properties \begin{itemize}
        \item For a real surface, the emissive power is less than that of a blackbody 
        \item We define a surface property - emissivity
        \item $\varepsilon(T) = \frac{E(t)}{E_b(t)}$ where $E(t)$ is integrated over all $\lambda$ and $\theta$ and $E_b(t)$ is integrated over all $\lambda$
        \item We will assume that $\varepsilon$ is independent of $\lambda$. This is known as a gray surface
        \item $\epsilon$ is independent of $\theta$: A diffuse surface
        \item The emissive power of a real surface is $E(t) = \varepsilon \sigma T^4$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Surface Absorption, Reflection and Transmission  \begin{itemize}
        \item $G$ is the incident radiation in $\frac{W}{m^2}$
        \item Part of it will be reflected ($G_{ref}$), part will be absorbed $G_{abs}$ and the rest will be transmitted ($G_{transmitted}$)
        \item $G$-radiation is the radiant energy incident on a surface per unit surface area per unit time 
        \item Define 3 properties: Absorptivity $\alpha = \frac{G_{abs}}{G}$, the reflectivity $\rho = \frac{G_{ref}}{G}$ and the transmittivity $\tau = \frac{G_{tr}}{G}$
        \item In general $\alpha + \rho + \tau = 1$
        \item For opaque objects, $\tau = 0$, for a blackbody $\alpha = 1$
        \item The "Gray Body assumption" is that $\alpha, \rho, \tau$ are independent of $\lambda$
        \item The "Diffuse surface assumption" is that $\alpha, \rho, \tau$ do not depend on direction 
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Radiation heat transfer - black surfaces} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider a small body inside an enclosre \begin{itemize}
        \item Let the small body have surface area $A$, emissivity $\epsilon$ and absorptivity $\alpha$
        \item The temperature inside the enclosure is $T$ and at equilibirum both the surface and the inside are at the same temperature 
        \item $G$ is the incident radiation per unit area 
        \item The large cavity acts as a black body
        \item We neglect absorption by the small body
        \item The cavity surfaces absorb all incident radiation 
        \item We can assume that $G = \sigma T^4$ 
        \item For a small body $E_{abs} = \alpha G A  =\alpha \sigma T^4 A$ is the energy absorbed
        \item $E_{emit} = \epsilon \sigma T^4 A$
        \item At equilibrium, $E_{abs} = E_{emit}$ so that $\sigma = \epsilon$
        \item This is Kirchoff's law which says that for any surface the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Radiation between surfaces \begin{itemize}
        \item Two surfaces which are exchanging energy due to radiation 
        \item Amount of radiation incident on a surface depends on the orientation of the surfaces 
    \end{itemize}
    \item The View Factor \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider two surfaces $i$ and $j$
        \item We define the view facor $F_{ij}$ as the fraction of radiation leaving surface $i$ that reaches surface $j$ directly
        \item e.g. $F_{1,3}$ is the fraction of energy leaving surface 1 which reaches surface 3 directly
        \item Can also define $F_{ii}$ for a concave surface which would be the fraction leaving it that reaches it on the other end 
        \item If the surface is convex, $F_{ii} = 0$
        \item If one surface $i$ is completely enclosed by another surface $j$, $F_{ii} = 0$ and $F_{ij} = 1$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Calculation of view factors \begin{itemize}
        \item Done by integrating geometric shapes
        \item Can calculate the energy exchanges $dA_1$ and $dA_2$
        \item For common geometries, the view factor calculations can be done based on charts and tables 
        \item Table 21.3, 21.4, Fig 21.33 can be used 
        \item In general, for an enclosure with $N$ sides, $\sum_{i=1}{N} F_{ij} = 1$
        \item All radiation leaving surface $i$ must be intercepted by other surfaces
        \item For an enclosure of $N$ surfaces, a total of $N^2$ view factors 
        \item These can be put into a matrix
        \item Not all view factors are independent. The summation rule says that $\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{i,j} = 1$
        \item The reciprocity rule \begin{itemize} 
            \item If $A_1, A_2$ are blackbodies then all incident radiation is absorbed so that $\alpha = \epsilon = 1$
            \item Then the energy leaving $A_1$ and reaching $A_2$ is $E_{b1} A_1 F_{12}$
            \item Doing the same in the reverse direction, the energy leaving $A_2$ and reaching $A_1$ is $E_{b2} A_2 F_{21}$
            \item The net energy exchange $Q_{12}$ is $Q_{12} = E_{b1} A_1 F_{12} - E_{b2} A_2 F_{21}$
            \item If both bodies are at the same temperature, there is thermal equilibrium so $Q_{12}  =0$
            \item Moreover $E_{b1} = E_{b2} = \sigma T^4$
            \item Thus $A_1 F_{12} = A_2 F_{21}$ 
            \item $A_1, A_2, F_{12}, F_{21}$ are all geometric properties independent of $T, \epsilon$
            \item Thus in general for any two surface $i, j$, $A_i F_{ij} = A_j F_{ji}$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Superposition \begin{itemize}
            \item Suppose you break up surface $j$ in two parts $a$ and $b$
            \item Then $F_{ij} = F_{i, ja} + F_{1, jb}$
        \end{itemize}
        \item Symmetry \begin{itemize}
            \item Consider a geometry such that surface $j$ and $k$ are identical 
            \item Then $F_{ij} = F_{ik}$ and $F_{ji} = F_{ki}$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example: Long duct of length $L$ \begin{itemize}
        \item A 3/4 circle with radius $R$ with area $A_2$ and the slice with area $A_1$
        \item $F_{12} = 1$. Note $F_{21} \neq 1$ since 2 is concave and not all of the radiation goes from there to $A_1$
        \item $A_2 F_{21} = A_1 F_{12} \implies F_{21} = \frac{A_1}{A_2} F_{12}$
        \item $\implies F_{21} = \frac{2R L}{\frac{3}{4} (2 \pi R) L} = \frac{4}{3 \pi} \approx 0.424$
        \item $F_{22} + F_{21}  = 1 \implies F_{22} = 1 - F_{21} = 0.576$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example: Small sphere under a concentric hemisphere \begin{itemize}
        \item $A_1$ is the area of the small sphere and $A_2$ is that of the hemisphere so that $A_2 = 2A_1$
        \item We can extend the hemisphere to a sphere and let $A_3$ be the area of the added region (ADD DIAGRAM)
        \item We know that $F_{11} + F_{12} + F_{13} = 1$ where $F_{11} = 0$ since it is a convex surface 
        \item By symmetric, $F_{12} = F_{13} \implies F_{12} = 0.5$
        \item By reciprocity, $F_{21} = \frac{A_1}{A_2} F_{12} = \frac{A_1}{2 A_1} 0.5$ so $F_{21} = 0.25$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Radiation from black surfaces \begin{itemize}
        \item Black surface means no reflection 
        \item All incident radiation is absorbed 
        \item Two surface $A_1$ and $A_2$ with temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ respectively 
        \item Energy from $A_1 \rightarrow A_2 = A_1 E_{b1} F_{12}$
        \item Energy from $A_2 \rightarrow A_1 = A_2 E_{b2} F_{21}$ 
        \item Net radiation exchange $\dot{Q}_{12} = A_1 E_{b1} F_{12} - A_2 E_{b2} F_{21}$ 
        \item Since $A_1 F_{12} = A_2 F_{21}$, $\dot{Q}_{12} = A_1 F_{12} (E_{b1} - E{b2})$
        \item $\implies \dot{Q}_{12} = A_1 F_{12} \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$
        \item Since $F_{12} = 1$, $\dot{Q}_{12} = A_1 \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Radiation Heat Transfer - Diffuse, Grey Surfaces} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read Chapter 21.8
    \item Not all surfaces are black 
    \item For a more realistic analysis, assume that surfaces are 1. Isothermal, 2. Opaque, 3. Diffuse ($\epsilon$ is independent of $\Theta$) and 4. Grey ($\epsilon$ is independent of $\lambda$)
    \item New Terms \begin{itemize}
        \item Define $G$ as the irradiation: total radiation that is incident on a surface per unit time and per unit area 
        \item Define $J$ as the radiosity: total radiation energy which leaves a surface per unit area and per unit time 
        \item $E = \epsilon E_b$. $J = \epsilon E_b + \rho G$ where $E_b = \sigma T^4$
        \item $\rho = 1 - \alpha = 1 -\epsilon$ 
        \item We can simplify $J$ as $\epsilon E_b + (1-\epsilon) G$
        \item Net energy leaving the surface per unit area: $\frac{\dot{Q}}{A} = J - G$ 
        \item The total energy is then $\dot{Q} = A(J - G)$ and since $J = \epsilon E_b + (1-\epsilon) G$, we can rearrange to get $G = \frac{J - \epsilon E_b}{1 - \epsilon}$
        \item Substituting this gives $\dot{Q} = A \left( \frac{\epsilon E_b - J}{1- \epsilon} \right)$ or $\dot{Q} = \frac{E_b - J}{ \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\epsilon A}}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Electrical analogy \begin{itemize}
        \item Can think of $R = \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\epsilon A}$ as a resistance 
        \item We call it the surface resistance to radiation 
        \item For a blackbody $\epsilon = 1 \implies R = 0$ and so there is no resistance 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Radiation exchange between grey surfaces \begin{itemize}
        \item Two grey surfaces, surface $i$ and surface $j$
        \item Net energy leaving surface $i$ is $J_i$ and the net energy leaving surface $j$ is $J_j$
        \item We are interested in the net exchange between these two surfaces
        \item Radiation from $i$ that reaches $j$ is $J_i A_i F_{ij}$
        \item Radiation from $j$ that reaches $i$ is $J_j A_j F_{ji}$
        \item Net heat transfer $\dot{Q}_{ij} = J_i A_i F_{ij} - J_j A_j F_{ji}$
        \item Using the reciprocity equation, $A_i F_{ij} = A_j F_{ji}$ which then means that $\dot{Q}_{ij} = A_i F_{ij} (J_i - J_j) = \frac{J_i - J_j}{(A_i F_i j)^{-1}}$
        \item We refer to $\frac{1}{A_i F_{ij}}$ as the space resistance and this depends on the shape of the surfaces and how they are oriented
    \end{itemize}
    \item Two surface enclosure \begin{itemize}
        \item Insert diagram and resistance
        \item $\dot{Q}_{12}  = \dot{Q}_1 = - \dot{Q}_2$
        \item Can write $\dot{Q}_{12} = \frac{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}{R_{total}} = \frac{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{1-\epsilon_1}{A_1 \epsilon_1} + \frac{1}{A_1 F_{12}} + \frac{1- \epsilon_2}{A_2 \epsilon_2}}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example \begin{itemize}
        \item Two surfaces. Top surface has $T_1 = 1000 K$, $\epsilon_1 = 1$ and bottom surface has $T_2 = 500 K$ and $\epsilon_2 = 0.8$
        \item What is the net radiation exchange between plates per unit area? 
        \item $A_1 = A_2 = A$, $F_{12} = 1 - (large plates)$
        \item Then $\dot{Q}_{12} = \frac{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{1-\epsilon_1}{A_1 \epsilon_1} + \frac{1}{A_1 F_{12}} + \frac{1- \epsilon_2}{A_2 \epsilon_2}}$ so that $\frac{\dot{Q}_{12}}{A} = \frac{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{1-\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_1} + 1 + \frac{1- \epsilon_2}{\epsilon_2}}$
        \item Simplifying, $\frac{\dot{Q}_{12}}{A} = \frac{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_2}} = \epsilon_2 \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example 2 \begin{itemize}
        \item See Lecture notes!
    \end{itemize}
